"# Fixing Electron App Notification Name: \"electron.app.Golden Apple\" → \"Golden Apple\"" 
""  
"## Problem Analysis"  
""  
"When sending notifications from your Electron app on Windows, the system displays \"electron.app.Golden Apple\" instead of just \"Golden Apple\". This happens because Windows requires an explicit AppUserModelId to be set for proper notification branding." 
""  
"## Root Cause"  
""  
"On Windows, Electron notifications use the default AppUserModelId which follows the pattern \"electron.app.[AppName]\". To fix this, we need to:"  
""  
"1. Set the AppUserModelId explicitly using \`app.setAppUserModelId()\`"  
"2. Ensure the app name is properly configured in package.json"  
"3. Make sure the configuration is applied before any notifications are created" 
""  
"## Solution: Step-by-Step Guide"  
""  
"### Step 1: Update Main Process (src/main/main.ts)"  
""  
"Add the Windows-specific AppUserModelId configuration right after the app imports and before the app.whenReady() call:"  
""  
"\`\`\`typescript"  
"// Add this code after the imports section (around line 38)"  
"// Set Windows AppUserModelId for proper notification branding"  
"if (process.platform === 'win32') {"  
"  app.setAppUserModelId('GoldenApple');"  
"}"  
"\`\`\`" 
""  
"**Where to place it:**"  
"Insert this code after line 38 (after the basePath definition) and before line 42 (before the ipcMain.on('ipc-example') handler."  
""  
"### Step 2: Verify package.json Configuration"  
""  
"Ensure your main package.json has the correct configuration:"  
""  
"\`\`\`json"  
"{"  
"  \"build\": {"  
"    \"productName\": \"Golden Apple\","  
"    \"appId\": \"GoldenApple\""  
"  }"  
"}"  
"\`\`\`" 
""  
"**Current Status:** ✅ Already correctly configured in your package.json (lines 190-191)"  
""  
"### Step 3: Update Release Package Configuration"  
""  
"Ensure the release/app/package.json also has consistent naming:"  
""  
"\`\`\`json"  
"{"  
"  \"name\": \"golden-apple\""  
"}"  
"\`\`\`"  
""  
"**Current Status:** ✅ Already correctly configured" 
""  
"### Step 4: Complete Code Integration"  
""  
"Here's the exact code to add to \`src/main/main.ts\`:"  
""  
"\`\`\`typescript"  
"// Add this after line 38 (after basePath definition)"  
"// Set Windows AppUserModelId for proper notification branding"  
"if (process.platform === 'win32') {"  
"  app.setAppUserModelId('GoldenApple');"  
"}"  
"\`\`\`" 
""  
"### Step 5: Test the Fix"  
""  
"After making the changes:"  
""  
"1. **Development Mode:**"  
"   \`\`\`bash"  
"   npm run start"  
"   \`\`\`"  
"   Trigger a notification and check if it shows \"Golden Apple\" instead of \"electron.app.Golden Apple\""  
""  
"2. **Production Build:**"  
"   \`\`\`bash"  
"   npm run build"  
"   npm run package"  
"   \`\`\`"  
"   Install the packaged app and test notifications" 
""  
"## Why This Works"  
""  
"- \`app.setAppUserModelId()\` sets the Windows Application User Model ID"  
"- This ID is used by Windows for notification branding, taskbar grouping, and start menu integration"  
"- The value should match your appId from package.json for consistency"  
"- This only affects Windows, so we wrap it in a platform check"  
""  
"## Additional Verification Points"  
""  
"### Notification Creation Code"  
"Your notification creation code in \`src/main/main.ts\` (line 318) is already correct:"  
""  
"\`\`\`typescript"  
"const notification = new Notification({ title, body });"  
"\`\`\`" 
""  
"### Package.json Build Configuration"  
"Your electron-builder configuration is properly set:"  
""  
"\`\`\`json"  
"\"build\": {"  
"  \"productName\": \"Golden Apple\","  
"  \"appId\": \"GoldenApple\""  
"}"  
"\`\`\`"  
""  
"## Troubleshooting"  
""  
"If notifications still show the wrong name after applying the fix:"  
""  
"1. **Clear Windows Notification Cache:**"  
"   - Restart Windows or use PowerShell: \`Get-AppxPackage *notifications* | Remove-AppxPackage\`" 
""  
"2. **Check for Multiple AppUserModelId Calls:**"  
"   - Ensure \`app.setAppUserModelId()\` is only called once"  
"   - Place it early in the app lifecycle (before app.whenReady())"  
""  
"3. **Verify AppId Consistency:**"  
"   - Make sure the value passed to \`setAppUserModelId()\` matches your package.json appId"  
""  
"4. **Development vs Production:**"  
"   - Test both development and packaged versions"  
"   - Sometimes development environments behave differently"  
""  
"## Files That Need Changes"  
""  
"### Required Changes:"  
"- ✅ \`src/main/main.ts\` - Add AppUserModelId configuration" 
""  
"### Already Correct (No Changes Needed):"  
"- ✅ \`package.json\` - productName and appId already set correctly"  
"- ✅ \`release/app/package.json\` - name already set correctly"  
"- ✅ \`src/main/main.ts\` - notification creation code already correct"  
""  
"## Summary"  
""  
"The fix is simple: add one line of code to set the Windows AppUserModelId before the app initializes. This will change the notification display from \"electron.app.Golden Apple\" to just \"Golden Apple\" on Windows systems."  
""  
"**Time to implement:** 2 minutes"  
"**Risk:** Very low (platform-specific code, no breaking changes)"  
"**Testing:** Verify notifications in both development and production builds"
